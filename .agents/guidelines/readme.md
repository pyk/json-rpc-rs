# README Writing Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Follow these guidelines strictly

> [!NOTE]
>
> README.md is for getting started and should include basic usage information
> only.

1. Start with a clear description of what the project does.
2. Provide quick start instructions that get users running immediately.
3. Include installation steps with examples.
4. List key features with brief descriptions.
5. Show usage examples with code blocks.
6. Be direct and actionable. Show exact steps with concrete examples.
7. Be honest about limitations. State what the tool can and cannot do clearly.
   When features are missing, acknowledge the limitation and provide workarounds
   or alternatives. Trade-offs should be explicit so users understand the design
   decisions.
8. Be practical over promotional. Focus on what users can do, not on marketing
   language like "powerful," "revolutionary," or "best-in-class."
9. Be honest about limitations. When a feature is missing or limited, say so
   directly and provide workarounds or alternative workflows.
10. Be direct and concise. Use short sentences. Get to the point. Developers are
    scanning, not reading novels.
11. Use second person. Address the reader as "you." Avoid "the user" or "one."
12. Use present tense. "The application opens the file" not "The application
    will open the file."
13. Avoid superlatives without substance ("incredibly fast," "seamlessly
    integrated").
14. Avoid hedging language ("simply," "just," "easily")—if something is simple,
    the instructions will show it.
15. Avoid apologetic tone for missing features—state the limitation and move on.
16. Avoid comparisons that disparage other tools—be factual, not competitive.
17. Avoid meta-commentary about honesty ("the honest take is...", "to be
    frank...", "honestly...").
18. Avoid filler words ("entirely," "certainly," "deeply," "definitely,"
    "actually")—these add nothing.
19. Use simple, direct English. Avoid complex words and academic phrasing.
    Examples: "multiple concerns simultaneously" -> "several concerns",
    "unnecessary coupling" -> "extra dependencies", "convoluted" -> "complex",
    "facilitate" -> "help" or "enable", "in order to" -> "to".
20. Use active voice. "Add feature" not "Feature was added."
21. Keep sentences short and to the point.
